// dynamic programming allows us to shave off time complexity by keeping data stored. as a result, we will not need to recalculate recurring items.
// there are two types of dynamic programming - memoization and tabulation. 

// memoization is often used with recursion - storing saved calls into a hashmap lets you retrieve them quickly and thus speed up the time complexity by a wide margin
