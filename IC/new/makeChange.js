// Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...

// They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

// Write a function that, given:

// an amount of money
// an array of coin denominations
// computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

//     Example: for amount = 444444(444444¢) and denominations = [1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3](111111¢, 222222¢ and 333333¢), your program would output 444444—the number of ways to make 444444¢ with those denominations:

//     1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
// 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
// 1¢, 3¢
// 2¢, 2¢
