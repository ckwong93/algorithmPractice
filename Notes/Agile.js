// Agile = set of values and principles used while creating software
// -making each decision based on the principles and values that the team has decided to follow
// -standup: meeting with coworks to discuss goals and objectives for the day
// -allows for flexibility & good for risk management
// -constant communication and feedback
// -time boxed, iterative, build and delivers with increments


// The core agile software programming practices are the following:

// Test - first programming(or perhaps Test - Driven Development),
// Rigorous, regular refactoring,
// Continuous integration,
// Simple design,
// Pair programming,
// Sharing the codebase between all or most programmers,
// A single coding standard to which all programmers adhere,
// A common “war - room” style work area.
